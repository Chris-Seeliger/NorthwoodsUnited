        <h1>Northwoods United Code of Conduct</h1>
        <h4>It is Northwoods United Soccer Club policy that safety is our #1 priority of the players, coaches, referees and spectators.</h4>

<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 5%;">Parent & Spectator Code of Conduct:</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">In order for your child to get the most out of the Northwoods United Soccer Club, it is important for you
to show support and offer encouragement while maintaining a genuine interest in the team, the club and
the sport. With a supportive attitude and a fundamental understanding of the game, everyone will come
away from their soccer experience with a positive feeling.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">Support Your Child</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Children derive many benefits from playing youth soccer such as good sportsmanship and self-discipline.
They learn how to work together, to sacrifice for the good of the team, to enjoy winning humbly and
handle defeat gracefully. In the process, they also learn important lessons about physical fitness and
personal goals. Remember that your children are PLAYING the game of soccer. While they should be
challenged to perform their personal best at the highest possible level, be careful not to impose your own
standards or objectives. As a parent, it is your responsibility to see that your child is on time and prepared
for every practice and game. If extenuating circumstances exist or a player has a physical limitation or
injury, you should immediately inform the coach about the problem.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">Games and Practices</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Parents and spectators can take the fun out of soccer by continually yelling or coaching from the sidelines.
Parents and spectators should enjoy the game, cheer for good plays and be supportive and encouraging. A
team’s performance improves by practicing together. Players, even good ones, cannot improve without
practice. Practice stresses the importance of teamwork, establishing goals, discipline and learning
emotional control, all of which are important lessons children can use both on and off the field. A player
not attending practice regularly may see reduced playing time in games, since it is not fair to the other
players who have put forth the time and effort to practice with the team.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">Good Sportsmanship</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Parents and spectators serve as role models for their children, who often look to adults for advice,
direction, and approval. One of the most important things you can do is show good sportsmanship at all
times to coaches, referees, opponents and teammates. Cheer them on as a team and individually as
well. Negative remarks from you reflect poorly, not only on the team and the club, but on you and your
child personally and can result in offense violations and or removal from the practice, game or club.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">Let the Coach, Coach!</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Your coach will be responsible for instructing your child during games and at practices. Coaches
receive training and dedicate countless hours on and off the field to make your child's soccer experience
rewarding. Some parents not only spoil the fun for their kids on the field trying to coach from the sideline,
but also in the car or at home, believing this is the perfect place for instruction. Parents should not
contradict the coach’s instructions. It is unfair to put children in a position of having to decide who to
listen to their parents or their coach. If a parent has a question or feels it is necessary to discuss an issue
with the coach, it must be done privately, at least 24 hours after the occurrence of the issue to be
discussed, and held at a mutually convenient time OUTSIDE of practice and game times. Please
remember that the Northwoods United Soccer Club is a program for our children to learn the game of
soccer from their coaches and trainers. Parents and spectators are expected to conduct themselves as
positive role models for good sportsmanship, discipline, and fair play. Interference or inappropriate
conduct by any players, coaches, parents, or spectators reflects poorly upon this organization and
thus will not be tolerated.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">Spectators Will</h3>
