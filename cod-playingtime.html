        <h1>PLAYING TIME/MAX ROSTER SIZE</h1>

<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;"v>Northwoods United Soccer Club believes that playing time during games is a critical factor in players’ development. Lack of playing
time limits a player’s ability to improve technically and tactically and to implement skills learned at practice. However the club also
understands the play leveling and skill levels can be different and must be considered as well. Below are the standards the coaches will
be using for general management of playing time for regular club games.</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">RECREATIONAL TEAMS</h3>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> U5 & U6: Minimum 30% target. 6 players (3v3 or 4v4)</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> U7 & U8: Minimum 30% target. 10 players (6V6, 1 must be a goalie)</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> U9 & U10: Minimum 30% target. 11 players (7v7)</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> U11 & U12: Minimum 30% target. 14 players (9v9), ideally 12 players</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> U13 & U14: Minimum 30% target, 15 players (11v11)</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">RECREATIONAL TEAMS TOURNAMENT PLAY</h3>

<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Every player on the roster that is present for tournament play must 
    play in every game. However there is not a set minimum time stamp. Coaches should strive for that 30% target, 
    but tournaments are considered competitive, even recreational tournaments.</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">COMPETITIVE & TRAVEL TEAMS</h3>

<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> Competitive & Travel team (all ages): There are no minimum playing time targets for individual games; playing time is
subject to the coach’s discretion based on technical and tactical abilities of the players. Coaches will strive to get all players
game time. During tournament play coaches will get players in to some degree in at least the majority of the games played for
the whole tournament. (Example, 3 game bracket, player to play in a minimum of 2 games, target of at least 30%).</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-top: 2%;">RECREATIONAL, COMPETITIVE, & TRAVEL TEAMS</h3>

<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Coaches may reduce playing time above the noted amounts at their discretion for individual players due to any of the following:</h5>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Poor attendance and/or punctuality at practices and/or games. (excused absence are considered)</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Poor effort, attitude, and/or behavior during practices and/or games.</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Poor fitness level, including injuries.</li>
<li style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;"> to work/play well with teammates and or listen/follow directions from the coaches.</li>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Northwoods United Soccer Club expects its coaches to consider what is best for individual players and what is best for the team as a
whole in determining how much playing time individual players receive, within reason.
Northwoods United Soccer Club expects its coaches to communicate decisions to limit/reduce playing time to the players who are
affected by those decisions as well as the parents of those players. Coaches should communicate the factors in their decisions, as well
as any steps that the player(s) can take to receive more playing time in the future. Coaches can have this communication in person
with the players and parents, but a text string or email string should also be used for league reference. Players with questions or
concerns about playing time may approach their coach directly in a manner prescribed by the coach.</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 2%;">Parents with questions or concerns about playing time should first communicate directly with the coach <u style="color: black;">(but not until a 24-hour
cooling down time following a game in which a concern over playing time is considered an issue)</u>. If a
parent does not follow the 24 hour cool down they could be subject to a Level 2 Offense Violation. In the event that parents and coach
are unable to resolve the issue, the chain of command to be used to resolve the problem is as follows: to Coach Coordinator, to Club
President and finally the issue may be brought up before the Board of Directors.</h5>
