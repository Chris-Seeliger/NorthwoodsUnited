        <h1>Weather Safety</h1>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left; padding-top: 2%;">HOT WEATHER:</h3>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left;">When temperatures and humidity rise above normal levels, the potential for risk
        rises. Be aware of these dangers and be prepared to stop or delay games to ensure proper hydration. Allow
        for frequent water stoppages in addition to substitution stoppages. Incidents of dehydration, heat
        exhaustion, heatstroke and sunburn are avoidable.</h5>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left;">Sunscreen of appropriate strength should be used by participants. Scheduling of games outside of the
        hottest part of the day, whenever possible, is preferred. When scheduling multiple games in a day or over
        several days when conducting tournaments, it is recommended that there are at least two hours between
        games and only two games per day for players is strongly recommended, unless the playing time is
        reduced.</h5>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left; padding-top: 2%;">COLD WEATHER:</h3>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left;">Risk of hypothermia, frostbite and injury from numbness are avoidable. Consider
        canceling games/practices when the weather is cold enough. Be aware of the dangers associated with cold
        weather and be prepared to delay or even terminate games to ensure proper protection of the players.
        Freezing rain, hail, snow, sleet or heavy rain can cause field conditions to deteriorate rapidly. . Players
        should be permitted to wear appropriate and safe clothing (extra garments under the jersey and shorts,
        knit hats and gloves, etc.) to protect against cold and windy weather conditions.</h5>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left; padding-top: 2%;">THUNDER/LIGHTNING:</h3>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left;">When thunder is heard or lightning is seen, seek shelter immediately. Do not
        wait for the rain to start before seeking shelter, and do not leave shelter just because the rain has ended.
        Restart games/practices after no thunder has been heard and no lightning has been seen for 30 minutes, or
        until the ALL CLEAR SIREN has been sounded.</h5>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left;">Parents you should watch for any possible weather concerns. If possible bad weather will be
        present all parents should stay and wait in the parking lot in the case bad weather hits and
        games/practices are called and players need to be picked up immediately. There is limited cover at
        the field locations and players are not allowed inside coaches vehicles, so parents please be
        prepared.</h5>
        <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; text-align: left; padding-top: 2%;">Coaches use your best judgement on severe weather and be prepared to cancel games/practices.
        Please try and give all parents adequate amount of time for cancelling of games/practices as many
        travel from great distances. All participants should be prepared to play in rain, snow and windy
        conditions as long as there are not severe weather concerns and the playing surfaces are safe, so
        dress accordingly. Coaches/Parents also need to understand that weather may be bad where they
        live but fine at the fields.</h5>
